This is my approach on reproducing a paper by Fleming et al. with Nextflow:


To run this pipeline you will need:
- Nextflow: https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html
    - I recommend self install method check success with bash command 'nextflow info'
- Anaconda3 (Conda): https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install
    - Ensure you have succesfully installed and attaached conda to path via bash: 'conda --version'
